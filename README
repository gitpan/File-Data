NAME
    File::Data - access the __DATA__ section in a program module (PM)

SYNOPSIS
      use File::Data

      $fh   = File::FileUtil->pm2datah($pm_file)
      $data = File::FileUtil->pm2data($pm_file)

DESCRIPTION
    There are times when the __DATA__ section of a program module (PM) are
    needed. The "File::Data" methods provides such access.

  pm2datah method
     $fh = File::FileUtil->pm2datah($pm_file)

    The *pm2datah* method will open the *$pm_file* and return a handle
    positioned at the first */[\012\015]__DATA__/* token occuring in the
    file. This function is very similar to the *DATA* file handle that Perl
    creates when loading a module file with the */[\012\015]__DATA__/*
    token. The differences is that *pm2datah* works whether or not the file
    module is loaded. The method does not close the file handle. Unlike the
    *DATA* file handle, which cannot be reused after the module data is read
    the first time, the *pm2datah* will always return an opened file handle,
    the first time, the second time, any time.

    CAUTION:

    If the */[\012\015]__DATA__/* token appears in the code section, say in
    a comment, or as a value assigned to a variable, the *pm2datah* method
    will misbehave.

  pm2data method
     $data = File::FileUtil->pm2data($pm_file)

    The *pm2data* uses the *pm2datah* to return all the data in a *$pm_file*
    form the *__DATA__* token to the end of the file.

QUALITY ASSURANCE
    The module "t::File::Data" is the Software Test Description(STD) module
    for the "File::Data". module.

    To generate all the test output files, run the generated test script,
    run the demonstration script and include it results in the "File::Data"
    POD, execute the following in any directory:

     tmake -test_verbose -replace -run  -pm=t::File::Data

    Note that tmake.pl must be in the execution path $ENV{PATH} and the "t"
    directory containing "t::File::Data" on the same level as the "lib"
    directory that contains the "File::Data" module.

  3.3 Changes
    Changes are as follows:

    Test-TestUtil-0.01
        Originated

    Test-TestUtil-0.02
        Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
        <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> test run

        t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....Bareword "fspec_dirs" not allowed while
        "strict subs" in use at

          /net/sunu991/disc1/.cpanplus/5.8.0/build/Test-TestUtil-0.01/blib/lib/Test/TestUtil.pm line 56.

        Changed line 56 from

         my @dirs = (fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

        to

         my @dirs = ($fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

        This error is troublesome since the test passed on my system using
        Active Perl under Microsoft NT. It should never have passed. This
        error is in a core method, *fspec2fspec*, that changes file
        specifications from one operating system to another operating
        system. This method has been in service unchanged for some time.

    Test-TestUtil-0.03
        Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
        <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> test run

        PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/perl/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM"
        "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')"
        t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....# Test 18
        got: '$VAR1 = ''; ' (t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t at line 540 fail
        #17) # Expected: '$VAR1 = '\\=head1 Title Page

        The *pm2datah* method is not returning any data for Test 18. This
        will also cause the test of *pm2data*, test 19 to fail. The
        *pm2datah* is searching for the string "\n__DATA__\n".

        The "\n" character on Perl is a logical end of line character
        sequence. The "\n" end of line is different on Mr. Smokehouse's Unix
        operating system than on my Windows NT operating system. The test
        file was created under MSWin32 and uses a MSWin32 "\n". Under UNIX,
        *pm2datah* method will look for the Unix "\n" and there will not be
        any.

        Changed "\n__DATA__\n" to /[\012\015]__DATA__/.

        During the clean-up for CPAN, broke the *format_hash_table* method
        for tables in hash of hash format. Fixed the break, added test 29 to
        the *t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t* test script for this feature, and
        added a discusssion of this feature in POD discription for
        *format_hash_table*

    Test-TestUtil-0.04
        item our old friend visits again - DOS and UNIX text file
        incompatibility

        This impacts other modules. We have to examine all modules for this
        portability defect and correct any found defects.

        Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
        <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> and Kingpin
        <mthurn@carbon> test runs.

        On Mr. Smokehouse's run email the got: VAR1 clearly showed extra
        white space line that is not present in the expected: VAR1. In Mr.
        Kingpin's run the got: VAR1 and expected: VAR1 look visually the
        same. However, the Unix found a difference(s) and failed the test.

        For Mr. Smokehouse's run:

        PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e"
        "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')"
        t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....NOK 18# Test

         Software Version Description

         for

          File::Data - Access the __DATA__ section of a program module

         Revision: F

        [snip]

        (t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t at line 565 fail #17) # Expected: '$VAR1

         Software Version Description

         for

          File::Data - Access the __DATA__ section of a program module

        What we have before, was a totally "failure to communicate." aka
        Cool Hand Luke. VAR1 was empty. Now VAR1 has something. It is not
        completely dead. One probable cause is the Unix operating system
        must be producing two Unix \012 new lines for a Microsoft single
        newline \015\012. Without being able to examine the test with a
        debugger, the only way to verify this is to provide the fix and see
        if the problem goes away when this great group of testers try for
        the fourth time.

        Revised *fin* method to take a handle, change *pm2datah* method
        handle, *$fh*, to binary by adding a *binmode $fh* statement, and
        pass the actual thru the *fin* method for test 18.

        Use *fin($fh)* to read in the data for *pm2data*, test 19 Unit Under
        Test (UUT), instead of using the raw file handle.

        The *fin* method takes any \015\012 combination and changes it into
        the logical Perl new line, *"\n"*, for the current operating system.

        *   At 02:44 AM 6/14/2003 +0200, Max Maischein wrote: A second thing
            that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
            "Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is
            descriptive of what the routines actually do or what the module
            implements. I would recommend renaming them to something closer
            to your other modules, maybe "Test::SVDMaker::Util" and
            "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as some routines do not seem to be
            specific to the Test::-suite but rather general
            (format_array_table). Some parts (the "scrub" routines) might
            even better live in another module namespace,
            "Test::Util::ScrubData" or something like that.

            Broke away all the file related methods from Test::TestUtil and
            created this module File::FileUtil so the module name is more
            descriptive of the methods within the module.

        *   Broke the smart nl code out of the fin method and made it is own
            separate method, smart_nl method.

            already does smart newline handling, (even though with the

            now :-))

            The only place where I see Perl does smart newline handling is
            the crlf IO displine introduce in Perl 5.6. The File::FileUtil
            has a use 5.001 so that 5.6 Perl built-ins cannot be used. Added
            comment to smart_nl that for users with 5.6 Perl that it may be
            better to use the built-in crlf IO discipline.

        *   For the load_package method that uses a eval "require $package"
            to load the package, the $@ does not capture all the warnings
            and error messages, at least not with ActiveState Perl. Added
            code the captures also the warnings, by temporaily reassigning
            $SIG(__WARN__), and added these to the $@ error messages.

        *   Added two new tests to verify the NOGO paths for the for the
            load_package method. One tests for load module failure looking
            for all the possilbe information on why the module did not load.
            The other verifies that the vocabulary is present after the
            loading the module. This information is very helpful when you
            must remote debug a load failure from CPAN testing whose is
            running on a different platform.

        Added the method *hex_dump*.

    File-FileUtil-0.03

        test_lib2inc
            Returns to parent directory of the first t directory going up
            from the test script instead of the t directory.

        find_t_roots
            Added the function find_t_roots that returns the parent
            directory of all the directories in @INC

    File-Data-0.01
        Removed the methods for converting a program module specification to
        its absolute file from the "File::FileUtil" module to their own
        module "File::Data" module. The module name is now more descriptive
        of the routines in the module.

    File-Data-0.02
        Changed prerequisite from "Test::STD::Scrub" to "Text::Scrub". This
        was a change to make the name more descriptive of the contents of
        the program module.

    File-Data-0.03
        Recoded using gensym to make sure file handle is a reference to a
        GLOB

    File-Data-0.04
    File-Data-0.05
        Change the test so that test support program modules resides in
        distribution directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory.
        Because they are no longer in the lib directory, test support files
        will not be installed as a pre-condition for the test of this
        module. The test of this module will precede immediately. The test
        support files in the tlib directory will vanish after the
        installtion.

    File-Data-0.06
        Regenerated the test script and added "File::Package" to tlib.

    File-Data-0.07
        The lastest build of Test::STDmaker expects the test library in the
        same directory as the test script. Coordiated with the lastest
        Test::STDmaker by moving the test library from tlib to t/File, the
        same directory as the test script and deleting the test library
        File::TestPath program module.

        Changed from the obsolete "File::PM2File" program module to the
        "File::Where" program module.

        the Perl release or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

         http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

        Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

        If all else fails, the file may be manually installed. Enter one of
        the following repositories in a web browser:

          http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/
          http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

        Right click on 'File-Data-0.07.tar.gz' and download to a temporary
        installation directory. Enter the following where $make is 'nmake'
        for microsoft windows; otherwise 'make'.

         gunzip File-Data-0.07.tar.gz
         tar -xf File-Data-0.07.tar
         perl Makefile.PL
         $make test
         $make install

        On Microsoft operating system, nmake, tar, and gunzip must be in the
        exeuction path. If tar and gunzip are not install, download and
        install unxutils from

         http://packages.softwarediamonds.com

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors
    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    *   All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.

    *   Add the requirements addressed as *# R: * comment to the tests

    *   Write a program to build a matrix to trace test step to the
        requirements and vice versa by parsing the *# R: * comments.
        Automatically insert the matrix in the module POD.
